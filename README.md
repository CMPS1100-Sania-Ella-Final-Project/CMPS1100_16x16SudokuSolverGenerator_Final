# 16x16 Sudoku Solver!
Welcome to our 16x16 Sudoku Solver! 

This code was written as part of the Midterm Project in 2024 for our Foundations of Programming class. The main reference is the Geeks for Geeks' backtracking algorithm to solve a traditional 9x9 Sudoku. This code uses iteration and back tracking to solve more complex 16x16 Sudoku puzzles and incorporates user input.
