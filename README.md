# 16x16 Sudoku Generator & Solver!
Welcome to our python code for a 16x16 Sudoku puzzle Generator and Solver! 

This code was written as part of the Final Project in 2024 for our Foundations of Programming class. The main reference is the Geeks for Geeks' backtracking algorithm to solve a traditional 9x9 Sudoku. This code uses iteration and back tracking to both solve and generate more complex 16x16 Sudoku puzzles. The graphic user interface makes it easier for the user to input a puzzle, allows the user to interact with a generated puzzle, and notifies them of any errors made
