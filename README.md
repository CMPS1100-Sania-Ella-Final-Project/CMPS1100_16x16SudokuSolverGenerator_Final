# 16x16 Sudoku Solver!
Welcome to our python code for a 16x16 Sudoku Solver! 

This code was written as part of the Midterm Project in 2024 for our Foundations of Programming class. The main reference is the Geeks for Geeks' backtracking algorithm to solve a traditional 9x9 Sudoku. This code uses iteration and back tracking to solve more complex 16x16 Sudoku puzzles and incorporates user input.

INSTRUCTIONS:
#1. Clone the repository using 'git clone.'
#2. Run 'python3 16x16SudokuSolver.py' with python version 3.12.5 or if you have an existing IDE, you should be able to open the file and run it directly.
#3. Follow the instructions and let us know how you like it!
